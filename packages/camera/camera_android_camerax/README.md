# camera\_android\_camerax

An Android implementation of [`camera`][1] that uses the [CameraX library][2].

*Note*: This package is under development, so please note the
[missing features and limitations](#missing-features-and-limitations), but
otherwise feel free to try out the current implementation and provide any
feedback by filing issues under [`flutter/flutter`][5] with `[camerax]` in
the title, which will be actively triaged.

## Usage

This package is [non-endorsed][3]; the endorsed Android implementation of `camera`
is [`camera_android`][4]. To use this implementation of the plugin instead of
`camera_android`, you will need to specify it in your `pubsepc.yaml` file as a
dependency in addition to `camera`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  # ...along with your other dependencies
  camera: ^0.10.4
  camera_android_camerax: ^0.5.0
```

## Missing features and limitations


### 240p resolution configuration for video recording

240p resolution configuration for video recording is unsupported by CameraX,
and thus, the plugin will fall back to 480p if configured with a
`ResolutionPreset`.

### Exposure mode, point, & offset configuration \[[Issue #120468][120468]\]

`setExposureMode`, `setExposurePoint`, & `setExposureOffset` are unimplemented.

### Focus mode & point configuration \[[Issue #120467][120467]\]

`setFocusMode` & `setFocusPoint` are unimplemented.

### Setting maximum duration and stream options for video capture

Calling `startVideoCapturing` with `VideoCaptureOptions` configured with
`maxVideoDuration` and `streamOptions` is currently unsupported do to the
limitations of the CameraX library and the platform interface, respectively,
and thus, those parameters will silently be ignored.
